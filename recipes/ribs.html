    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Baby back ribs (also called pork back ribs) come from high on the back of the hog, where the loin muscle meets
        the backbone. This lean cut of pork is extremely tender and flavorful.

    <p>
        Baby back ribs can be smoked, grilled, or baked. They're usually seasoned and often served with a sweet and
        savory barbecue sauce. We will show you how to make baked ribs in this recipe!
